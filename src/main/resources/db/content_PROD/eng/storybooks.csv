Every autumn, the birds migrate to Mexico and to southern United States. They navigate with the rotation of the Polaris star of the Ursa Minor constellation (also known as Little Bear). Polaris lies at the end of the bear\u2019s tail and is also known as the North Pole Star. It indicates the direction to the north pole and is always seen in the northern hemisphere.
