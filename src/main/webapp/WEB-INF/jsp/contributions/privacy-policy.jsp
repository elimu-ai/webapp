    <p>
        This policy provides transparency on how the elimu.ai webapp protects 
        the privacy of its users (contributors):
    </p>
    
    <ol class="browser-default">
        <li>
            When a contributor signs onto this website 
            for the first time, we store the anonymous provider ID (from 
            Discord/GitHub) in order to recognize the same contributor when 
            she/he returns at a later point in time.
        </li>
        <li>
            A contributor's e-mail address will never be shared with 
            third-party organizations.
        </li>
        <li>
            We keep track of each contributor's contributions. As an example, each 
            time a contributor uploads a word's audio recording to the website, 
            we store information about this event. The reason for doing this is 
            so that other community members can peer review the content and 
            quality approve the contribution.
        </li>
        <li>
            A community member can request a deletion of her/his account and any 
            corresponding data at any point in time. To initiate deletion, send 
            an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@elimu.ai">info@elimu.ai</a>.
        </li>
    </ol>
