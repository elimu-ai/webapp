    <p>
        This policy provides transparency on how the elimu.ai Community protects 
        the privacy of its community members (contributors):
    </p>
    
    <ol class="browser-default">
        <li>
            When a community contributor signs onto this website 
            for the first time, we store the anonymous provider ID (from 
            Google/GitHub) in order to recognize the same contributor when 
            she/he returns at a later point in time.
        </li>
        <li>
            A community member's e-mail address will never be shared with 
            third-party organizations.
        </li>
        <li>
            We keep track of each contributor's contributions. As an example, each 
            time a contributor uploads a word's audio recording to the website, 
            we store information about this event. The reason for doing this is 
            so that other community members can peer review the content and 
            quality approve the contribution.
        </li>
        <li>
            A community member can request a deletion of her/his account and any 
            corresponding data (e.g. audio recordings) at any point in time. To 
            initiate deletion, send an e-mail to 
            <a href="mailto:info@elimu.ai">info@elimu.ai</a>.
        </li>
    </ol>
